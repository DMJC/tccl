# TCCL
Thrustmaster Configuration Control for Linux
- A Linux reimplementation of TARGET focusing on the HOTAS Warthog Joystick
- Frontend Code is written in GTKMM/C++ and is based on wejoy. https://github.com/Vantskruv/wejoy

---
How to Use:
- TLLC will output .lua files which can be loaded using wejoy. Eventually I plan to integrate launching wejoy with a selected profile into the application making it a one stop shop.
